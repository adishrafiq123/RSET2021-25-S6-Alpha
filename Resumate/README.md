Resumate - Resume Parser and Job Compatibility Checker

Manually scanning through resumes to find candidates fit for a role can often be a time-consuming and tedious task for employers and managers. Recruiters may accidentally fail
to notice well-qualified candidates and may face difficulties when trying to read through resumes that follow a different format compared to the usual one.

Resumate is an automated tool that is used to analyze resumes quickly and efficiently. It performs resume parsing and job compatibility checking. Resume parsing involves the extraction of appropriate information from a candidate’s resume and presenting it to hiring managers in an organized manner.
The extracted information can be used to check the compatibility of the candidate’s skill set and qualifications with the role’s requirements. This aids in effectively screening resumes while saving time, money, and energy.
